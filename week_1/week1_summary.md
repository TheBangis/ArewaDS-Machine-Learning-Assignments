# Week One Summary
In this week lesson we have take of four topics which includes, Introduction to machine learning. History of Machine Learning, Fairness and Techniques of Machine Learning.

#### How to get started with machine learning
Before to starts machine learning you need to have you computer set up and ready to run notebook locally.
1. Install python in your system
2. Learn python or R programming language
3. Have a Github account
4. Knows machine learning library

#### AI, ML and Deep Learning

the above venn diagram show the relationship betweem AI, ML and Deep Learning.

#### Why Study Machine Learning
Machine learning thinks like a human brain does, they all learn certain things based on the data they perceive and make decision.

## History of Machine Learning
Alan turing in 1950s and other researchers lay the foundition of developing a machines that can think.

In the year 1956 at a conference held in Darthmouth in USA called Darthmouth Summer Research Project the word 'Artificial Intelligence' was coined.

The period between 1956 - 1974 was the period called 'The golden years'.
Research was well funded by government agencies, technological advancement were made in computation and algorithms, and prototypes of intelligent machines were built. Some of these machines include:
1. Shekey the rebot
2. Eliza
3. Blocks world

## AI Winter
Betweent 1974 - 1980 was the period called AI Winter many issues were raised against AI and fund was dried, people were scared of the implication they thinks it would reduce job opportunities and machine like Eliza is a threat to society and confidence in the fieled slowed other issues includes:
1. Limitations. Compute power was too limited
2. Combinatorial explosion
3. Paucity of data.

## Fairness in Machine Learning
Fairness in machine learning is the process of correcting and eliminating algorithmic bias from machine learning model. Algorithmic bias is when a model makes unfair or inaccurate decisions based on variable that are considered sensitive such as race, gender, sexual orientation, disability and class. 

Example: A model that predicts whether someone will default on a loan may be biases if it uses race as a factor or if it is trained on data that reflects historical discrimination against certain groups.

### Techniques of Machine Learning
Techniques of machine learning refer to the different methods and approaches used to train machine learning models to learn from data and make predictions. There many different techniques of machine learning some of them include: 
1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Semi-supervised Learning
4. Reinforcement Learning
5. Transfer Learning and many more:
